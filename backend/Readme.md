# React + Node boilerplate
This is a simple boilerplate for a React frontend and Node backend project. Contains some example functionality.
 Backend with CRD, Docker-compose that supports development, working DB and fluent UI/UX.  
 If you're new to React + Nodejs, feel free to copy what I did. Can't guarantee that everything is done in the best way, but it should at least give you some image.  

## How to run  
With these simple steps you can start developing your new project:  
* (for now) Git clone the project
* Start with `docker-compose up`
* Start doing stuff
